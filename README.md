NITEVis
=======

OpenNI/NITE vizualization tool for Windows x64.
This program uses GPU shaders, old GPUs are thus not supported.
OpenNI/NITE must be installed on the system.

About
-----

NITEVis is similar to the NIViewer example that comes with OpenNI, but it was much faster on my system and has some additional visualization features, most importantly support for image-based transfer functions (see DepthColors.png and LabelColors.png).

I pulled this together quickly, use with caution.
